## Citing and Related Documentation
#### doi
#### Publication coming 'soon'!
## Purpose
#### This program was written to handle time resolved U-Pb zircon data using LA-ICP-Quadrupole-MS. This is effectively the sister to [LaserTRAM-DB](https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/laserTRAM-DB#readme) ([Lubbers et al., 202x](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7826697)) which was built for handling trace elements using the same instrumentation. The program was born from a need to measure young zircons on the quadrupole and is built to handle isotopic ratios for the analyst that wants to count as long as possible during analysis (i.e., no trace elements). A variety of reduction techniques are available to reduce isotopic ratios, as described below.
## Data Input Format
#### Similar to LaserTRAM-DB, the [multifiler](https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/multifiler) repository  make the data prepared for LaserTRAMZ after deleting the 'Timestamp' header that is output in the LT_ready file.
