# LaserTRAMZ
## Citing and Related Documentation
#### doi
#### Publication coming 'soon'!
## Purpose
#### This program was written to handle time resolved U-Pb zircon data using LA-ICP-Quadrupole-MS. This is effectively the sister to [LaserTRAM-DB](https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/laserTRAM-DB#readme) ([Lubbers et al., 202x](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7826697)) which was built for handling trace elements using the same instrumentation. The program was born from a need to measure young zircons on the quadrupole and is thus not built to handle isotopic ratios and trace elements. A variety of reduction techniques are available to reduce isotopic ratios.
## Data Input Format
#### Similar to LaserTRAM-DB, the [multifiler](https://github.com/jlubbersgeo/multifiler) repository  make the data prepared for LaserTRAMZ after deleting the 'Timestamp' header that is output in the LT_ready file.
